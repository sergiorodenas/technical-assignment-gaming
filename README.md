# Technical assignment back-end engineer

A new leaderboard feature needs to be developed for a gaming platform. Instead o
f giving you a data set you are free to create your own based on the following knowledge:
* Every play is scored.
* Each play has a game and gun configuration as outlined in [this JSON](./games.json) file.
* There is no limit on how often a player plays a specific configuration.

The leaderboard should give insights on each player's rank and percentile with the possibility to filter on game and gun configuration.

## Minimal requirements

- Use the Laravel PHP framework
- Use MySQL
- Build an API, the user interface is less relevant
- The data set should consist of at least 1 million plays
